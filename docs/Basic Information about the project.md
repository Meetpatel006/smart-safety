# Basic Information about the project

**Official Problem Statement**: Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System using AI, Geo-Fencing, and Blockchain-based Digital ID

**Organization**: Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region

**Category**: Software

**Theme**: Travel & Tourism

## 🎯 Problem Context & Background

The Northeast Region (NER) of India is a tourism hotspot but faces unique challenges in ensuring tourist safety due to:
- Remote and challenging terrain
- Limited connectivity and infrastructure
- Weather-related risks (monsoons, landslides)
- Wildlife encounters in eco-tourism areas
- Cultural and language barriers for non-local tourists
- Limited emergency response infrastructure
- Need for real-time monitoring of tourist movements

The solution should specifically address the safety concerns of tourists visiting the Northeast Region while promoting responsible tourism and providing authorities with tools for effective incident response.
