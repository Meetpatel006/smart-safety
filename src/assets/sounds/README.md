# Alert Sound

Place an alert sound file named `alert.mp3` in this directory.

The sound should be:
- Format: MP3
- Duration: 1-2 seconds
- Type: Alert/notification sound
- Volume: Clear but not jarring

You can find free alert sounds at:

For now, the app will gracefully handle the missing sound file (it just won't play audio for major deviations).
