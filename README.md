## Project Overview

The Smart Tourist Safety application is designed to enhance the safety and security of tourists visiting destinations in India, with a special focus on the Northeast Region (NER). The system provides real-time monitoring, geo-fencing alerts, blockchain-based identity verification, emergency response mechanisms, and AI-powered safety recommendations to ensure tourists can enjoy their travel experiences with confidence and security.

This comprehensive solution addresses the unique challenges faced in ensuring tourist safety in the Northeast Region, including remote terrain, limited connectivity, weather-related risks, wildlife encounters, cultural/language barriers, and limited emergency response infrastructure.

## Problem Statement

**Official Problem Statement:** Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System using AI, Geo-Fencing, and Blockchain-based Digital ID
